# üõ†Ô∏è SupplyChain üõ†Ô∏è 
The DAML application models a supply chain scenario where customers can place orders, suppliers can approve orders, orders can be delivered, payments can be made, and orders can be canceled.

### I. Overview
The DAML application models a supply chain scenario where customers can place orders, suppliers can approve orders, orders can be delivered, payments can be made, and orders can be canceled.

Key Data Structures:
OrderEnquiry: Represents an order inquiry created by a customer. It includes details such as customer, supplier, product, quantity, and price.
Order: Represents an order contract, including order details, status (e.g., ordered, delivered, canceled), and delivery address.
Payment: Represents a payment record between a customer and a supplier.
Address: A data record representing an address with fields for street, city, postal code, and country.
Cust and Suppl: Data records representing customer and supplier details.

### II. Workflow
1. Customer can start the order enquiry
2. Customer can Places Orders
3. Supplier can Approves Orders (Order contract will be created)
4. Customer can Updates Delivery Address
5. Supplier can Delivers Orders
6. Customer can Cancels an Order
7. Customer can Receives and Pays an Order (Payment contract will be created)
8. Supplier can Confirms Payment

### III. Challenge(s)
* The project was created by using `empty-skeleton` and the following was removed from `daml.yaml`:
```
sandbox-options:
   - --wall-clock-time
```
and the following was added:

```
init-script: SCMTest Setup

```

### IV. Compiling & Testing
To compile and test, run the pre-written script in the `Test.daml` under /daml OR run:
```
$ daml start
```
Test coverage report
```
$ daml test --show-coverage
